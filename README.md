# Â¡Hi! IÂ´m Agustin ðŸ‘‹

I am a **full-stack developer**. Over the past few months, I've been working on personal projects that sparked a lot of interest in me, leading to a **shift in my vocation**.

I am committed to **continuing my learning journey** and I am more than interested in **joining a team** where I can contribute not only with my code, but also with my enthusiasm and passion for technology.

## Technologies I work with:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, NestJS, Express
- **DataBase**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDb

## Projects I worked in:
- [Tournament Creation](https://github.com/estebannecuse/PadelArena-Back): App for creating and managing Paddle single elimination tournaments
- [e-commerce API](https://github.com/Agusdor96/agus-ecommerce): REST API for managing an e-commerce APP.
- [Appointments ClimbingClub](https://github.com/juan/music-api):  An appointment application built with React and NestJS.
